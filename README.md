## An album-centered subsonic client for Xbox and the Terminal

SonicLair.NET is a minimal, album-centered music client for subsonic compatible music servers built using .net Core 6 and UWP, designed to run on Xbox and the terminal (Windows, Linux and macOS).

## Features

- Connect to any subsonic-compatible music server. Tested on Navidrome.
- Album-centered music playing: if you start playing a song, the album becomes your playlist.
- Start a radio based on any song on your library.
- Search throughout your entire music library.

## Installation and Usage

### Xbox Retail Mode

### Xbox Developer Mode

I'm working on getting a pipeline on github actions to get signed bundles for installing on Xbox via the Device Portal. Soon!

### Terminal

[<img src="./ghlogo.svg" width="150px">](https://github.com/thelinkin3000/SonicLair.Net/releases)

The terminal version is an (almost) self contained executable. You can grab the version for your operating system from the releases page. Within the compressed file there is the excutable and (if applicable) the libvlc libraries needed for the audio backend to work. Please keep the directory structure as is.

### Linux caveats

For linux, the app will search for the relevant libvlc files from your installation.

For Ubuntu and Debian

    sudo apt update
    sudo apt upgrade (if you haven't done it in a while)
    sudo apt install libvlc-dev libx11-dev

And then you can try the app. If it complains that it can't instantiate libvlc try

    sudo apt install vlc
